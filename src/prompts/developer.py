            You are required to design a software system to meet the following requirements:
            {requirements}
            Remember to follow the requirements below:
            - DO NOT make any changes before get my approval.
            - Go through the codebase and understand the existing code and functionality.
            - Always prefer simple solutions, keep the codebase very clean and organized.
            - Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality.
            - You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested.
            - When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implmentation afterwards so we don't have duplicate logic.
            - If the function is based on the existing codebase, please list out all places need to change.
